## Introduction
A tree is a data storage method that when graphed looks similar to a tree specifically its roots (cause most of the time you view it upsides).
From the root node of the tree a branching path is formed that will eventually end on a leaf (a node that contains no children).
Binary trees only contain two nodes, often called left and right node.

Commonly trees are used in searching algorithms due to their speed, in a compression method, or for AI in the form of a behaviour tree.
In this case binary trees are not used for speeding up searches rather for controlling the splits in sections of the screen.

## How Binary Trees Are Used
To begin with a node in this tree can be both a leaf and a joining node.
The way to tell the difference between a branch and leaf is that a leaf will contain the clients information and no children while a branch just has 2 children nodes which are not null / empty.
While rare in some cases a branch can have a single child node. If this is true the node should be considered as unstable.

From there certain information about the node is passed along the tree. This information includes:
- Workarea: The boundaries to which a node can hold its content in. (This includes padding referred to as gap in code)
- Split percentage: The percentage amount the split is from the "left" side of the node. (Only used in branches)
- Direction: The direction the split occurs on, Vertical or Horizontal. (Only used in branches)
- Client: The actual client.

With this information the are gets subdivided and the position of the clients are calculated and set resulting in the layout.

Bellow is an example layout and the resulting binary tree.

## Why Use A Binary Tree
One of the limitations that is commonly found in other forms of layouts is attempting to add a new client and it commonly appearing in the smallest point on the screen, or the largest point.
Furthermore, resizing individual clients can result in all the clients in the same row / column also getting resized if that is even possible to do.
With a binary tree some of these limitations are reduced.

For example (using the diagram above), if you want to put a client right under application 1 to be vertical simply set the layout to do a vertical split and create the new client.
The result will be that area 1 gets cut in half with client 1 being put on top (left) and the new application being put on the bottom split (right).
Furthermore, if you want to increase the size of client 2 area start a resize event (mouse drag or keyboard keys) and drag in the way you want to increase.
All the other splits will adjust to respect the new sizes while maintaining the position of the split.

## Wait Where Did I Hear / See This Before?
If you have used text editors such as Neovim, Vim, or Vi, IDE such as Visual Studio, VSCode, or any Jetbrains IDE, Window managers such as I3, then you most likely have either used or heard of such a method of splitting before.

## Features Of The Layout
Here is a list of features that the layout can currently do.
- Dynamically alter the direction of a branch.
- Resize branches based on the corner dragged of a client. \(Mouse Handler Event)
- Resize branches with in-code methods.
- Show notifications when you change the direction.
- A widget that can indicate the direction of the next split is provided.
- Mouse support for swapping clients around.

## Known Issues
Sadly even this layout has some issues.
- When a reset occurs \(I.E. you reload the awesomewm configs) the former layout data is lost. This is sadly one thing that cannot be fixed easily.
However, a failsafe has been added to ensure that if such an event were to occur all clients would be arranged horizontally according to the split rules.
- An application opened and closed so many windows that the layout broke. You can simply reset the configs and that should fix the issue, but you loose the layout data, unfortunately.
- Zoom, or more specifically an application that is opening more windows than it should.
This issue relates to the previous issue and probably the best fix would be to either contact the development team and ask them either remove the extra window or mark them as floating better.
Otherwise, you can set up rules for the window to ensure they are floating or behaving properly.

- No inbuilt way to swap clients around.

Sadly, this is a more complex issue to solve as a lot of questions get asked such as do I swap clients or the branch nodes around and if I wanted to swap with a direction, but it turns out that direction had more than one node which node to I swap with, and where do I start in the tree to swap stuff.

In theory the resulting method call might have maybe 6 to 8 arguments and who knows how many unique functions requiring very advanced knowledge of what occurs in the tree. So in other words this will come out soonâ„¢. No but really this will take a while to be implemented if ever.

## Installation Guide
Warning: This guide assumed you have some knowledge of basic programing, the Lua language, and awesomewm API. If something does not quite make sense try to search for it as I attempted to not use too much complex programming theory.

### Prerequisites
- Awesome Version 4.3. Not an actual requirement just the development version just in case it breaks in a later version.
- None. Assuming I did not accidentally call something that should not be called it should be a standalone addition.

### Step 1: Clone the repo
Clone the repo into a config directory. (commonly `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/awesome/` assuming you made your own custom config or `/home/{username}/.config/awesome/`)

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ShadowKing345/awesomewm-binary-tree-layout.git binaryTreeLayout
```

Remember the relative path of where the folder is put.

### Step 2: Requiring the file in your rc.lua file
In your `rc.lua` you must call the `require` method for the layout builder at least once.

```lua
require("binaryTreeLayout") --change to be the correct relative path for you.
```

This is because some logic is performed before the creation of the layout that only occurs during the `require` call.
You can simply store the resulting table from the `require` method for later use.

```lua
local binaryTreeLayoutBuilder = require("binaryTreeLayout") --change to be the correct relative path for you.
```

This variable will be used later on in the examples.

If you by any chance call this after any other feature provided such as the widget it will result in a file not found as the internal require calls fail to find other lua files used.

### Step 3: Building the layout
In order to actually get the layout you will have to call the self build method , providing optional arguments as needed.

```lua
awful.layout.layouts = {
  -- ... Other layouts.
  
  binaryTreeLayoutBuilder({}),
  
  -- ... Other layouts.
 }
 ```

Leaving the table (`{}`) empty will simply result in the default settings being set and is recommended for first time users.
A list of available arguments can be found [here](#layout-builder)

### Step 4: (Optional) Setting up notifications or the widget
Here we will set up the direction change notifications and the widget. If you don't want to do any you can skip the section.

#### Sending Notification
When building the layout one of the arguments that can be passed is `send_notifications`. If set to true it will result in the change split direction methods (explained later on) to send a notification.

```lua
awful.layout.layouts = {
  -- ... Other layouts.
  
  binaryTreeLayoutBuilder({send_notifications=true}),
  
  -- ... Other layouts.
}
```

#### The Widget
A widget is provided that allows you to view the next split direction as well as toggle it with a mouse click.
You can easily find it with the relative path plus widget and will return a builder that can be called to create the widget with some settings.

```lua
local binaryTreeLayoutWidgetBuilder = require("binaryTreeLayout.widget")

-- somewhere in your taskbar (for example).

binaryTreeLayoutWidgetBuilder({}) -- Will return the actual widget.
```

The widget itself provides some methods to control the split direction and the image as well as tooltip text.

```lua
-- widget is not a defined variable fyi. this is just an example.

widget:toggleDirection() -- Toggles the direction and if set send a notification.

-- Note the : is important as a null pointer error will be sent telling you that self is null if you use a dot instead.
```

One the widget is loaded and showing simply clicking it will change the direction and change the icon used.

### Controlling The Direction
The layout builder provides 3 methods to control the direction:

- horizontal: Sets to split horizontally.
- vertical: Sets to split vertically.
- toggleDirection: Toggles between the two split directions.

These methods can be used to control the direction of the split from code. For example a keybinding can be created to toggle between the two directions.

```lua
-- This is an example function you can put inside of awful.key.
function ()
  binaryTreeLayoutBuilder.toggleDirection() -- Toggles between the two directions.
end
```

If you want to get or set the direction of the next split, a global variable is set in order to provide syncing between tags and screens.

```lua
BINARY_TREE_LAYOUT_GO_VERTICAL 
```

Please be aware that it is recommended to use the provided widget and methods to control the direction of the splits.
However, if you are comfortable writing your own code then the method of changing the direction of the split has been made as simple as possible and documented as much as possible.

Furthermore, an in-code method of changing the direction of a branch has been provided by the method `binaryTreeBuilder.toggleNodeDirection(client)`, where the client is the client that you wish to change the direction of the parent node of.

### Resizing or Moving Clients
In the case of resizing the client there are two available methods. The first and most easy to set up since it comes right out of the box is mouse dragging.

Assuming you have the default keybindings setup all you have to do is put your mouse pointer on the end of a client, hold Mod4 ( Windows key or Control Key (mac)), right click and drag. The window will begin to resize it's self with respect to the nearest corner you grabbed.

For keyboard or in-code methods to resize a client please go [here](#setting-keybindings-for-the-layout). Please note this is a more advanced setup to do.

Moving clients around is as simple as swapping the clients around. For mouse, assuming you have default keybindings setup Mod4 + left mouse click and begin dragging a window should cause windows to begin to swap with each other.

At the moment there is no in-code or keyboard method of doing this other than the `awful.client.swap.byindex` method call but this may result in visual weirdness as clients get swapped in unexpected patterns as they are not in an expected order for this.

If you want to move around the selected clinet with a keyboard the default keybindings will work perfectly fine in this case.

## Additional Settings
Both builders contain additional settings that can be changed to better suit the user's needs.

### Layout Builder
The layout builder contains the following options:
* name: The name the layout will be set to. 
**This should not be changed from default unless you understand what will happen.**
Change this if you have a conflict occurring with another layout.
* start_vertical: Changes the starting direction of layout (Default: false)
* send_notifications: Set to true to have the layout send a notification when the direction switch methods are called.
* respect_client_borders: If set to true the border of each client will be calculated by the client.border_width property. If set to false the beautiful.border_width will be used instead. (Default: true)
* debug: Set to true to output the content of the tree to the console (assuming you can see it).

### Widget Builder
The widget builder contains the following options:
* style: A table that contains styling options.
  * icons: The location of the icons used.
    * horizontal: The horizontal icon.
    * vertical: The vertical icon.
* toolTipString: A method or string that is used to set the text for the tool tip.
* buttons: A collection of `awful.button` that defines the mouse click events.

## Additional Notes
- Setting layout_binaryTreeLayout or layout_\[name you set for the layout] will set the icon used in the standard `layoutbox` widget.
An icon file has been provided in the folder `icon.svg`. You can use your own if you want since the one I made is quite large.

## Advanced Stuff
This section is mainly meant for developers and individuals who would like to better understand or alter the layout in a certain way.

### TOC
- [Overwriting A Method](#i-do-not-like-how-you-handled-xyz-is-there-a-way-i-can-change-it)
- [Modifying the size of clients with code](#setting-keybindings-for-the-layout)

### I Do Not Like How You Handled X,Y,Z. Is There A Way I Can Change It?
Yes there is a way. Most of the methods are made the equivalent of public for Lua.
This means that you can overwrite them completely to do what you want instead.

For example. If you want to change the layout handler perform these steps:
```lua
--First, Generate the layout using the builder.
local layout = binaryTreeLayoutBuilder({})

--Then simply overwrite the arange method to do what you want instead.
function layout.arange(p)
--... Your code.
end

--Or

layout.arange = function(p) --[[..Your code]] end
```

Most of the provided documentation should give you a fairly decent understanding of what parameters are that need to be provided.
Some are provided by awesomewm itself such as with arrange and the mouse handler.

Note: Some methods are put in the builder itself such as toggle directions and not the actual layout.
Look into the lua files to see which one is used where. If it is inside the build method then its most likely a layout method else it's a builder method.
The layout builder is the init.lua file.

### Setting Keybindings For The Layout
While Awesome Window Manager does have a builtin method for setting the sizes of layouts its rather limited and is basically a shot in the dark as to what it actually does.
This is especially true for this layout method of handling clients and nodes. As such the layout manager will provide its own layout manipulation functions that can be called to alter the size of client.

The function name is called resize, and it is found inside the layout object that was built not the builder object.
the way to access it is as follows.
```lua
-- ... other client rebindings
awful.key({ --[[ mod key setup ]] }, --[[key to press]],
  function(c) -- c means the client.
    c.screen.selected_tag.layout.resize(c, 0.1, "right")
  end,
  --[[ Usual description information ]]),
-- ... other client rebindings
```
The function takes in 3 arguments:
- The client to modify the size off,
- The delta amount in terms of floating percentage i.e. 0.1 is the same as 10%, and
- The direction to pull towards (left, right, up, and down).

Providing these arguments will cause a client to resize. In the above example it will grow to the right of the client by 10%.
* Note: If you try to resize towards the edge of the screen nothing will happen as there is no client in that direction. Additionally, a client will not be allowed to become too small as sizes of 0 are not allowed.

If you plan on using multiple layouts you will need to perform a quick check before you can execute the resize method which is as follows.
```lua
function(c) --c is the client
  if c.screen.selected_tag.layout.name == "BinaryTreeLayout" --[[ or to whatever you set the name as ]] then
    c.screen.selected_tag.layout.resize(c, 0.1, "right")
  else
    -- The default methods for increase the size of layouts.
  end
end
```
Since the names are meant to be unique this quick check should work to ensure that you are modifying the correct variable.

To explain the process a bit better:
1. c.screen: You are getting the screen where the client is on (There is no way to get the selected tag other than through the screen).
2. screen.selected_tag: You are getting the active tag of the selected client. As in the tag which is visible to the user.
3. selected_tag.layout: You are getting the layout currently active in the selected tag.
4. layout.name: Finally, you are getting the name of the layout and checking if that is the correct name.

The explanation is a bit excessive but that is because you would have no idea why I am doing this other than from reading the docs and finding out for your self.

If you know a better way of getting the layout or selected tag of the client then this please let me know in an issue as I do also think this is a bit excessive as well.
